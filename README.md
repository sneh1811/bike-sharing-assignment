## General Information
- This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model for predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- The background of the project is centered around a bike-sharing service provider, BoomBikes, which is seeking to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market post the COVID-19 lockdown.
- The business problem is to model the demand for shared bikes based on various independent variables, helping BoomBikes tailor their business strategy to meet customer expectations and stand out in the market.
- The dataset used for this analysis includes information on daily bike demands across the American market, considering factors such as weather conditions, seasons, and years.

## Conclusions
- The analysis revealed significant variables influencing the demand for shared bikes.
- The 'yr' variable, indicating the year, proved to be valuable in predicting bike demand.
- The model provides insights into how different features contribute to variations in bike demands.
